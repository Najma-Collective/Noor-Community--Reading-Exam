An Email About a New Hobby
Hi Alex,
How are you? I'm writing to you because I want to tell you about my new hobby. I joined the local photography club! I started three weeks ago.
Our club meets every Thursday evening at the community centre. The first meeting was great. We learned about the different parts of a camera. My camera is not very new, but it is good enough to learn with. My teacher says the person taking the photo is more important than the camera.
Last week, our meeting was outdoors. We walked around the city centre and took pictures of interesting buildings and people. It was really interesting to look at the city in a new way. I took lots of photos to show you.
The people in the club are very friendly. My favourite part is seeing everyone's photos at the end of the week and talking about them. It is the best part of my week so far!

Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40
The Invention of the Bicycle
The bicycle is one of the most popular forms of transport in the world. People use them to travel to work or school, for exercise, or for fun. But who invented it, and why?
The history of the bicycle started with a German man named Karl von Drais. In 1817, he invented a "running machine". It was made of wood and had two wheels, but it had no pedals. To move, a person had to push their feet along the ground.
In the 1860s, French inventors added pedals to the front wheel. This machine was called the velocipede, but it was very uncomfortable on the stone roads and was called the "boneshaker".
Then, in the 1870s, the "high-wheel" bicycle appeared. It had a very big front wheel and a small back wheel. It was faster, but also very dangerous. If the rider hit a small stone, they could easily fall off.
The first modern bicycle, called the "safety bicycle", was created in the 1880s. It had two wheels of the same size and a chain to connect the pedals to the back wheel. This design was much safer and more comfortable. This basic idea became very popular in England and then spread all over the world.
While many people helped to develop it, the "safety bicycle" was the invention that made cycling popular for everyone. Because of this clever design, we now have a convenient and enjoyable way to travel.
Questions 27-33
Do the following statements agree with the information in the text? Choose:
TRUE = the text confirms it.
FALSE = the text contradicts it.
NOT GIVEN = the text gives no information about it.
The bicycle was invented by one person.
The first "running machine" had pedals.
The "boneshaker" was not comfortable to ride.
The "high-wheel" bicycle was slower than the "boneshaker".
The "high-wheel" bicycle was not very safe.
The "safety bicycle" had two wheels that were different sizes.
The "safety bicycle" first became popular in Germany.

Four Online Book Reviews
Here’s what our readers think about this month’s popular books.
A. The Lighthouse Mystery by Sarah Jenkins
I couldn't put this book down! It's a classic detective story set in a small, isolated village. The main character, Detective Miles, is a retired police officer who has to solve the strange disappearance of the lighthouse keeper. The plot has so many twists and turns that keep you guessing. I was sure I knew who the criminal was, but the ending completely surprised me. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good, page-turning mystery. - Liam
B. A Journey to the Stars by Kenichi Tanaka
This is a science-fiction novel about the first human mission to Mars. The author does a fantastic job of describing the technology and the challenges the astronauts face. However, for me, the story focused too much on the technical details. I felt the characters weren't very well developed, so I didn't feel an emotional connection to them or their journey. It's a good read if you are passionate about space travel, but less so if you prefer character-driven stories. - Chloe
C. Drawing for Beginners by Maria Rossi
I bought this book because I wanted to learn a new creative skill. It's full of easy-to-follow lessons with clear instructions and helpful pictures for each step. Last night, I followed the lesson on drawing faces, and my family was very impressed! The book also includes a great section on basic skills, like understanding light and shadow. It has given me much more confidence with a pencil. A perfect book for any new artist. - David
D. The Last Elephant by David Wilson
This non-fiction book is about the work of conservationists trying to protect elephants in Africa. It's a powerful and sometimes sad story about the dangers that elephants face from poaching and habitat loss. The author, a wildlife photographer, includes many of his own stunning photographs. The book is well-researched and full of facts, but it's also a very personal and emotional account. It really makes you think about our responsibility to protect these amazing animals. - Fatima

Reading Passage 2: Questions 11-20
The Rise of the Modern Podcast
In many countries around the world, listening to podcasts has become a very popular activity. In the last ten years, their number has grown enormously. But what are the reasons for this huge increase in popularity?
Firstly, podcasts offer a huge variety of content. In the past, radio was limited to a few topics like news and music. Now, there is a podcast for almost every interest, from science and history to comedy and storytelling. This variety attracts a wide range of listeners who are looking for special, focused content.
Secondly, they have become a perfect medium for modern life. People can listen to podcasts while doing other things, such as driving, exercising, or doing housework. Many people download episodes to their phones and listen without needing an internet connection. This makes them a popular choice for commuters, people at the gym, or anyone with a busy schedule. It is a convenient way to learn something new or be entertained.
Finally, the quality of podcasts has become very important. There is a growing number of high-quality shows with excellent research, sound design, and skilled hosts. Many independent creators can now produce shows that are as good as those from large media companies. Listeners appreciate this and often form a strong connection with their favourite podcast hosts.
This combination of variety, convenience, and quality has transformed the simple audio show into a central part of modern media.
Questions 11-20

Reading Passage 3: Questions 21-40
An Ocean of Plastic
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a huge area of plastic rubbish floating in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean. It is the largest collection of ocean plastic in the world, located between Hawaii and California. It is not a solid island of plastic that you can walk on. Instead, it is made up of billions of pieces of plastic, some large and some very small, spread over an enormous area.
Most of the rubbish comes from land. Plastic bags, bottles, and other items are not recycled and are carried by rivers out to the sea. Other plastic, like fishing nets and equipment, is lost from boats. Sunlight and ocean waves break the larger pieces of plastic down into tiny pieces called microplastics. These microplastics are very difficult to clean up because they are so small.
This plastic pollution is a serious problem for marine life. Sea turtles can mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, their favourite food, and eat them. Birds and fish can get caught in old fishing nets. The microplastics are also eaten by small sea creatures, which are then eaten by bigger fish. This means the plastic can enter the food chain, which is dangerous for animals and potentially for humans too.
Scientists and environmental groups are working to find solutions. Some organisations have developed special systems to collect the larger pieces of plastic from the ocean. However, everyone agrees that the most important solution is to stop the plastic from getting into the ocean in the first place. We can all help by reducing our use of single-use plastic, such as straws and bags, and by recycling correctly.

C. Very small pieces of plastic
Why are plastic bags dangerous for sea turtles?

Reading Passage 1: Questions 1-13
The Benefits of Urban Green Spaces
Cities are often seen as places of concrete and steel, but the presence of green spaces, like parks, gardens, and even small patches of trees, is essential for the health of a city and its people. These areas provide numerous benefits, both for the environment and for the people who live and work in urban areas.
One of the most important environmental benefits of green spaces is that they help to improve air quality. Trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the air and release clean oxygen. This process helps to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere, making the city a healthier place to breathe. Furthermore, areas with trees are often cooler than areas with only buildings. This "cooling effect" can help reduce the need for air conditioning in the summer, which in turn saves energy.
The benefits for people are just as significant. Studies have shown that spending time in nature can reduce stress and improve mental well-being. A walk in a park can help people feel more relaxed and refreshed. Parks also provide a space for physical activity, such as walking, running, or playing sports. This is very important in cities where people may have jobs that require them to sit at a desk all day.
Finally, urban green spaces are important for social reasons. They are places where people can meet, interact, and build a sense of community. Parks often host community events, markets, and festivals. They provide a common ground where people from different backgrounds can come together. By providing these environmental, health, and social benefits, green spaces make cities more liveable and sustainable places for everyone.
Questions 1-7
Do the following statements agree with the information in the text? Write:
TRUE = the text confirms it.
FALSE = the text contradicts it.
NOT GIVEN = the text gives no information about it.
Green spaces are only useful for the city's environment.
Plants take in pollutants and give out oxygen.
Areas with trees can be warmer than areas with buildings.
Most new cities are designed with many green spaces.
Being in a park can make people feel less stressed.
The text suggests that physical activity is particularly important for people with office jobs.
Parks can help people from different backgrounds connect with each other.
Questions 8-13
Complete the sentences below. Write ONE WORD ONLY from the text for each answer.
Green spaces are vital for the __________ of a city and its residents.

Reading Passage 2: Questions 14-26
The History of the Public Library
A. The idea of a library, a place where knowledge is collected and stored, is very old. However, for most of history, libraries were private collections available only to wealthy individuals, priests, or scholars. The concept of a public library—a place funded by the community, for the community—is a much more recent invention.
B. The first library that was truly public in the modern sense is believed to have been opened in Peterborough, England, in 1633. However, it was a small collection and the idea did not spread quickly. The real growth of the public library movement began in the mid-19th century. A key moment was the passing of the Public Libraries Act in the United Kingdom in 1850. This law allowed local councils to collect money from citizens to establish and manage free libraries.
C. A major figure in the history of public libraries was Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish-American industrialist. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Carnegie used his enormous wealth to support the creation of thousands of public libraries. He gave money to build over 2,500 libraries across the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries. His condition was that the local town had to provide the land and promise to fund the library's operations.
D. The purpose of these early public libraries was clear: to provide education and opportunities for self-improvement to the working classes. At a time when books were expensive and formal education was limited, libraries offered ordinary people a chance to learn and improve their lives. They were seen as an important tool for social progress.
E. Today, the role of the public library continues to change. While they still provide access to books, modern libraries offer much more. They are important community hubs, providing free access to computers and the internet, offering classes on digital skills, hosting events for children and adults, and providing quiet spaces for work and study. They have adapted to the needs of the 21st century, but their core mission—providing free and open access to information for everyone—remains the same.

Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40
The Psychology of Colour
Colour is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and even cause physiological reactions. Certain colours have been associated with increased blood pressure, increased metabolism, and eyestrain. So how exactly does colour work? And how is colour perception used in our daily lives?
In marketing and branding, colour is a critical tool. Think of a well-known brand, and its main colour probably comes to mind immediately. This is no accident. Companies spend a great deal of time and money on colour research. For example, the colour red is often associated with energy, passion, and excitement. Therefore, it is often used to encourage 'buy now' decisions or for businesses that want to appear dynamic. Blue, on the other hand, is seen to suggest security, trust, and calmness. This makes it a popular choice for banks and technology companies that want to make their customers feel safe.
The meaning of colours can also change significantly between different cultures. For instance, in many Western cultures, white is the colour of purity and is traditionally worn at weddings. However, in many parts of Asia, white is the colour associated with mourning and funerals. Similarly, while red might mean danger in South Africa, it is the colour of good luck and prosperity in China. This is a vital consideration for global companies that want their brands to be successful in different parts of the world.
Beyond marketing, colour can also affect performance. Studies have suggested that seeing the colour red before a challenging exam can negatively affect test scores. It is thought this is because red is strongly associated with failure or danger (e.g., a teacher's red pen marking mistakes). In contrast, the colour green is often linked to creativity and can help inspire new ideas. This is why some people recommend having a green plant on your desk when you are working on a difficult problem. The effects are often subtle, but they demonstrate that colour perception is a significant, and often unconscious, part of our daily experience.
Questions 27-33
Choose the correct letter, A, B, C, or D.
What is the main point of the first paragraph?
A. Colour can only influence our mood.
B. Colour can have a noticeable effect on our bodies.
C. Colour is mainly used to increase metabolism.
D. The way colour works is not fully understood.
Why do companies research colour?
A. To make their products more beautiful.
B. To connect their brand with certain feelings.
C. To make their advertisements cheaper.
D. To follow international laws on branding.
According to the text, the colour blue is good for banks because it suggests...
A. energy.
B. passion.
C. security.
D. excitement.
What does the text say about the colour white?
A. It has the same meaning in every culture.
B. It is associated with happiness everywhere.
C. Its meaning is different in Asia and the West.
D. It is the most popular colour for global brands.

A. companies should avoid using red.
B. cultural meaning is an important factor.

The concept of remote work, or telecommuting, is not new, but the global shift towards this model of employment has been dramatic in recent years. Enabled by advancements in digital communication technology, millions of people now perform their job duties from home rather than a traditional office. This transition is not merely a change in scenery for employees; it carries significant economic implications for businesses, workers, and cities.
For businesses, the primary economic advantage is a potential reduction in overhead costs. Companies can save substantial amounts on rent, utilities, and office maintenance by reducing their physical footprint. This financial flexibility can be redirected towards growth, innovation, or employee benefits. Furthermore, by removing geographical barriers to hiring, companies can access a wider, more diverse talent pool. This can lead to a more skilled and productive workforce. However, businesses also face challenges, such as the initial cost of providing technology for home offices and the difficulty of maintaining a strong company culture and fostering spontaneous collaboration.
From the employee's perspective, the economic benefits are often clear. The most significant saving comes from the elimination of commuting costs, both in terms of money spent on transport and time saved. Remote work can also offer greater flexibility, allowing for a better work-life balance and potentially reducing costs associated with childcare. On the other hand, remote workers may find themselves paying more for home utilities and needing to invest in their own office equipment. There is also the risk of social isolation and the 'always-on' culture, where the line between work and personal life becomes blurred, which can have its own indirect costs on well-being.
The widespread adoption of remote work also has a profound impact on urban economies. Cities with a high concentration of office workers have seen a sharp decline in daytime populations in their central business districts. This affects a whole ecosystem of businesses, from public transport systems to cafes and retail stores that rely on the daily influx of commuters. While this poses a major challenge to city centres, it may also create opportunities for suburban and rural areas to thrive as people spend more of their time and money in their local communities. The long-term economic geography is being redrawn, with consequences that are still unfolding.

Biomimicry: Nature's Guide to Innovation
A For centuries, humans have looked to the natural world for inspiration. From early myths of people flying like birds to the practical use of plant-based medicines, nature has always been a source of ideas. In the modern era, this practice has been given a formal name: biomimicry. Coined in 1982, the term refers to the conscious process of learning from and then emulating nature's forms, processes, and ecosystems to create more sustainable and effective human technologies. At its core, biomimicry operates on a simple but powerful principle: nature has already solved many of the problems we are grappling with.
B One of the most famous and easily understood examples of biomimicry is the invention of Velcro. In 1941, Swiss engineer George de Mestral was walking his dog in the Alps. Upon returning home, he noticed that his dog's fur was covered in burrs from a burdock plant. When he examined the burrs under a microscope, he saw they were covered in hundreds of tiny hooks that latched onto the loops in the fabric of his trousers and his dog's fur. This hook-and-loop system inspired him to create the two-sided fastener we know today as Velcro, a technology that is now used globally on everything from shoes to equipment used on spacecraft.
C A more complex example of emulating nature's design can be seen in architecture. The Eastgate Centre, a large office and shopping centre in Harare, Zimbabwe, was designed without a conventional air-conditioning system. The architect, Mick Pearce, was inspired by the structure of termite mounds. These mounds maintain an almost constant temperature inside, despite extreme fluctuations in the outside temperature. They achieve this through a system of vents that they constantly open and close. Pearce applied this principle to the Eastgate Centre, using special building materials and a series of vents to draw in cool night air and flush out the warm air generated during the day. This passive cooling system uses less than 10% of the energy of a conventional air-conditioned building of the same size.
D The potential applications of biomimicry are vast. Scientists are studying how the shape of a whale's fin can lead to more efficient wind turbine blades. Others are examining the water-repellent properties of the lotus leaf to create self-cleaning surfaces. The core idea is a shift in perspective: instead of seeing nature as a resource to be exploited, we see it as a mentor. It represents a move away from the 'heat, beat, and treat' model of industrial production towards more elegant, energy-efficient, and sustainable solutions that are in harmony with the natural world.

Reading Passage 3: Questions 27-40
The Decline of Letter Writing
Has the art of letter writing been lost to the digital age? In an era of instant messaging and social media updates, the idea of composing a letter, placing it in an envelope, and sending it via postal service can seem slow and inefficient. Critics of this shift argue that we are losing a valuable and intimate form of communication, while proponents of digital media suggest it is simply a natural evolution.
There is a strong argument that the process of letter writing encourages a different, more considered, form of thinking. Unlike an email or a text message, which can be written and sent in seconds, a letter requires time and effort. The physical act of writing by hand, the need to gather one's thoughts without the possibility of an instant 'delete' key, and the awareness that the recipient will read the words at a later date all contribute to a more reflective and deliberate style of communication. The letters of historical figures are often studied as detailed records of their thoughts and feelings, a depth that is arguably absent from a collection of today's fleeting digital messages.
Furthermore, a physical letter carries an emotional weight that digital messages often lack. The choice of paper, the writer's handwriting, even the stamp and postmark, all become part of the message. It is a tangible object that can be kept, reread, and treasured for years. This physical presence creates a powerful connection between the sender and receiver. Receiving a personal letter can feel like receiving a small gift, a piece of the sender's time and attention, which is a rare commodity in our fast-paced world.
However, it is impractical to ignore the advantages of digital communication. Its speed and efficiency are undeniable and essential for the functioning of modern society. We can communicate with people on the other side of the world instantly, share documents and images with a single click, and maintain constant contact with a wide network of friends and family. Digital platforms have made communication more accessible and democratic. To argue for a full return to letter writing would be to ignore the significant benefits that technology has brought us.
Perhaps the solution is not to view these forms of communication as being in competition. A text message is perfect for confirming an arrangement, and an email is ideal for a formal business inquiry. The personal letter, however, could be reserved for occasions where a deeper, more personal connection is desired. It may no longer be our primary method of communication, but it can still be a meaningful one. Its decline in frequency may even increase its value as a special and thoughtful gesture.
Questions 27-32
Do the following statements reflect the claims of the writer in the text? Write:
YES = the text confirms it.
NO = the text contradicts it.
NOT GIVEN = the text gives no information about it.
The writer believes that letter writing is completely outdated and has no place in the modern world.
The slowness of writing a letter can be a positive attribute.
The handwriting on a letter is an important part of its overall message.
People in the past wrote more letters because they had more free time.
The writer acknowledges the essential role of digital communication in today's world.
The writer suggests that digital communication and letter writing can coexist.

The Cognitive Puzzles of Bilingualism
For decades, researchers have been investigating the effects of bilingualism on the human brain. Early studies, conducted in the mid-20th century, often suggested that being bilingual created a cognitive burden, leading to confusion and developmental delays. This perspective, however, has been overwhelmingly refuted by modern research. The contemporary view is that the bilingual brain is a highly adaptive and efficient system, and that managing two languages confers a range of cognitive advantages.
The core challenge for a bilingual person is one of constant selection. When a bilingual person wishes to speak, both of their languages are typically active in their brain. For example, when a French-English bilingual sees a dog, the words 'chien' and 'dog' are both activated. The brain must then select the appropriate word for the context while inhibiting the other. This process of selection and inhibition is not a burden but rather a form of constant mental exercise. It is believed to strengthen the brain's executive functions—a suite of cognitive abilities responsible for tasks such as attention control, problem-solving, and task switching.
This 'mental gymnastics' appears to have tangible benefits that extend beyond language. Numerous studies have shown that bilingual individuals tend to outperform monolinguals on tasks that require strong executive control. For example, in the classic 'Stroop test', where participants must name the colour of the ink a word is printed in (e.g., the word 'blue' printed in red ink), bilinguals are often faster and more accurate. They are better able to ignore the misleading information (the word itself) and focus on the relevant task (naming the ink colour). This suggests that the skill of inhibiting one language is transferable to other domains that require cognitive flexibility.
Furthermore, this lifelong cognitive training may have a protective effect on the brain as it ages. A growing body of research indicates that bilingualism can delay the onset of symptoms of cognitive decline, including those associated with dementia. This is attributed to the concept of 'cognitive reserve'—the brain's ability to cope with damage by using pre-existing cognitive resources more efficiently. By constantly exercising its executive functions, the bilingual brain builds up this reserve, making it more resilient to the neurological changes that occur in later life. While bilingualism does not prevent such diseases, it appears to provide the brain with the tools to function at a higher level for longer, even when disease is present. This finding has profound implications for public health and our understanding of lifelong learning.
Questions 1-6
Do the following statements agree with the views of the writer in the text? Write:
YES = the statement agrees with the views of the writer
NO = the statement contradicts the views of the writer
NOT GIVEN = it is impossible to say what the writer thinks about this
The earliest research into bilingualism was largely accurate in its conclusions.
The need to choose between two active languages is beneficial for the brain.
Executive functions are solely responsible for language production.
Bilinguals tend to have better eyesight than monolinguals.
The cognitive advantages of bilingualism are limited to language-related tasks.
Bilingualism can stop the development of age-related brain diseases.

Evidence for these benefits can be seen in experiments where bilinguals show superior performance on tasks requiring (10)__________ flexibility. This lifelong brain training may also have a (11)__________ effect in later life. Research suggests bilingualism helps build up a (12)__________ reserve, which can delay the symptoms of cognitive (13)__________, although it does not prevent the underlying diseases.

The Philosophy of Open Data
A The concept of 'open data'—the idea that certain data should be freely available for everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright or patents—is one of the most significant shifts in information management of the 21st century. At its heart, it is a philosophy built on principles of transparency, collaboration, and innovation. While the movement has gained considerable momentum, its implementation poses complex challenges, balancing the ideal of unrestricted access with practical concerns about privacy, security, and data quality.
B The primary argument for open data is its potential to empower citizens and foster democratic accountability. When governments publish data on public spending, crime rates, or environmental quality, they provide citizens and journalists with the raw material to scrutinise official policies and hold leaders accountable. This transparency can lead to more efficient governance and a reduction in corruption. For example, open data initiatives have enabled organisations to track foreign aid spending, ensuring that funds are directed to their intended projects.
C Beyond its civic benefits, open data is a powerful engine for economic and scientific innovation. When private companies and researchers are given access to large datasets—such as weather patterns, genomic information, or transport logistics—they can identify new trends and develop novel products and services. Many successful mobile applications, for instance, are built on publicly available mapping and transport data. In the scientific community, open access to research data accelerates discovery by allowing researchers to replicate, verify, and build upon the work of others, rather than starting from scratch.
D However, the path to truly open data is fraught with obstacles. One of the most significant is the issue of personal privacy. Much of the data collected by public bodies contains sensitive information about individuals. While techniques like anonymisation can help, there is an ongoing debate about whether it is possible to release detailed data without creating a risk of re-identification, where individuals can be traced. This creates a fundamental tension between the desire for transparency and the right to privacy.
E Another major challenge is ensuring data quality and usability. Raw data is often complex, poorly structured, and difficult to interpret without specialist knowledge. For data to be genuinely 'open', it must not only be legally accessible but also practically usable. This requires investment in standardisation, documentation (metadata), and user-friendly platforms. Without this, the data remains 'open' in name only, accessible to a small group of experts but closed to the wider public it is intended to serve. The open data philosophy, therefore, is not just about data release; it is about building a sustainable information ecosystem.

Shifting Paradigms in Urban Planning: The '15-Minute City'
The modern metropolis, with its sprawling suburbs and reliance on the automobile, is a product of 20th-century planning. This model, however, is facing increasing scrutiny due to its environmental and social costs, including traffic congestion, pollution, and social isolation. In response, a new paradigm is gaining traction among urbanists: the '15-minute city'. Popularised by Professor Carlos Moreno, the concept proposes a radical reorganisation of urban life, where all essential daily needs—work, commerce, healthcare, education, and recreation—are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from one's home.
The philosophy behind the 15-minute city is 'chrono-urbanism'—planning a city not around space, but around time. It seeks to end the long, stressful commutes that define the lives of millions by creating a 'policentric' city. Instead of a single, dominant city centre where all activity is concentrated, the policentric model envisions a network of self-sufficient, vibrant neighbourhoods. Each neighbourhood would have a mix of housing, offices, shops, parks, and cultural venues. This approach not only saves residents time but also aims to improve quality of life, reduce carbon emissions, and foster a stronger sense of local community.
Implementing such a vision requires a significant departure from conventional planning practices. It involves decentralising services, repurposing existing infrastructure, and prioritising pedestrians and cyclists over cars. A key strategy is 'tactical urbanism', which uses low-cost, temporary changes to public spaces—such as creating pop-up bike lanes or pedestrianising streets—to test and demonstrate the benefits of a more human-scaled environment. Another critical element is the promotion of 'mixed-use' zoning, which allows for a combination of residential, commercial, and business spaces within the same area, a practice often discouraged by 20th-century zoning laws that favoured strict separation.
Critics of the 15-minute city model raise valid concerns. One major issue is the risk of exacerbating social inequality. In cities with high property values, creating highly desirable, walkable neighbourhoods could drive up housing costs, effectively excluding lower-income residents and creating enclaves of privilege. Without robust social housing policies and equity-focused planning, the vision of a city of accessible neighbourhoods could devolve into a city of segregated villages. Another criticism is that the model may be less applicable to sprawling, low-density cities, particularly in North America, where retrofitting car-dependent suburbs presents a monumental challenge.
Despite these challenges, the 15-minute city concept has become a powerful influence on urban planning discourse worldwide. It forces us to question the long-held assumptions that have shaped our cities and to imagine a future that is more local, sustainable, and centred on human well-being. It is less a rigid blueprint and more a guiding principle, adaptable to different local contexts, that prompts a fundamental rethinking of what a city is for.
